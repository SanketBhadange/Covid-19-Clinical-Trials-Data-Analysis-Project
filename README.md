# COVID-19 Clinical Trials - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on COVID-19 clinical trials data using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL, and Excel**. The goal is to analyze the dataset from **ClinicalTrials.gov** to extract meaningful insights about the status, phases, study designs, demographics, and other important aspects of COVID-19 clinical trials worldwide.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database Querying**: SQL
- **Data Handling**: Excel
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔍 Dataset Information
The dataset is sourced from **ClinicalTrials.gov**, a database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies. The dataset includes both **XML files** (for each study) and a **CSV file** containing summarized trial data.

- **Dataset Source**: [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)
- **Download Dataset**: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WessMr8tdADxk04uVT-AaoP3_CxwJIYR/view?usp=sharing)
- **Sample Notebook for Reference**: [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/eda-on-covid-19-clinical-trials)

## 📊 Project Objectives
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Handle missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data.
  - Convert date fields to appropriate formats.
  - Extract additional insights from textual data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Analyze trial **statuses** (e.g., completed, recruiting, suspended).
  - Explore **trial phases** (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.).
  - Investigate study **designs and conditions**.
  - Perform **time-series analysis** on the start dates of clinical trials.

- **Data Visualization**
  - Generate bar charts, histograms, and time-series plots to illustrate trends.
  - Compare distributions of various attributes like **age groups, funding sources, and country contributions**.

## 🚀 Key Insights from the Analysis
- The majority of trials are in the **completed phase**, with some still recruiting.
- Most trials focus on **adult populations** rather than children or elderly groups.
- The **United States, France, and the UK** contribute the highest number of trials.
- There is a **steady increase** in the number of trials over time.

## 📈 Visual Representations
Some key plots generated in this project include:
- **Bar Charts**: Distribution of clinical trial statuses and phases.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Trends in trial registrations over time.
- **Geographic Analysis**: Country-wise distribution of clinical trials.

## 🏆 Future Enhancements
- Implement **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** on study descriptions for more insights.
- Apply **Machine Learning** techniques to predict trial success rates.
- Create an **interactive dashboard** for real-time visualization.
